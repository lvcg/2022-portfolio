# 2022 Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my work and skills for potential employers and collaborators.

## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three fundamental technologies utilized to craft web pages and applications:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** Used for structuring web pages, defining their layout through tags.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Styles the HTML elements, controlling the visual aspects like colors, fonts, and layouts.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and dynamic features to websites, such as animations, form validation, and media players.

## Final Product:

More updates are on the way! Stay tuned for additional projects added to the list.
