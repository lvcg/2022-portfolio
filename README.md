## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three essential technologies used to create web pages and web applications. They are all programming languages that allow developers to create interactive content for websites.

HTML is the markup language that is used to structure a web page. It defines the layout of a document by using a system of tags. CSS is the style sheet language that is used to style the HTML elements on a web page. It can be used to control the look and feel of a website, including colors, fonts, and layouts. JavaScript is the programming language that makes websites dynamic and interactive. It can be used to add features such as audio and video players, animations, form validation, and more.
